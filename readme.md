### General Information about the Application

This application is intended for general use & is a fun console-version of the Mastermind board game. Gameplay includes the computer rendering a row of 4 numbers between 0-4 on a "pegboard" and keeping said row of 4 numbers hidden from user's sight. The user must then submit guesses consisting of a row of 4 numbers between 0-4 in hopes that their guess contains each correct number in correct positioning. The computer will provide feedback for each number in the user's row of 4 numbers indicating whether the number is either *correct number in correct position*, *correct number in incorrect position*, or *incorrect number in incorrect position*. The user must use logic to instruct future guesses based on this feedback.

This application is programmed using **`C#`**. This application utilizes a number of *Collections* including arrays & lists and also utilizes *regular expressions* (RegEx).

  

>  **Room for Improvement**

>  * Need to print a message to user upon successfully completing a round of Mastermind detailing how many guesses the user took to guess the computer's code-row correctly.

>  * Need to store game history to an external file.
