/// This application can be played in the console and is based on the game Mastermind.
/// The Console App will have the computer render a code that is 4 colors randomly selected
/// from Red, Black, White, Green, Blue, or Yellow. The user has to try to guess the code and
/// has 10 tries to crack the code. The computer will help the user understand how their guess
/// lines up to the correct code by giving either White or Red Marks: Red Marks means that there
/// is a correct color in the correct position and White Marks means that there is a correct color
/// in the incorrect position.
